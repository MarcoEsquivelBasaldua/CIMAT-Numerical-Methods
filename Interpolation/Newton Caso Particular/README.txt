Code description:
    Given the function sin(x_i), this code gets four interpolation points as:
    (x_0,sin(x_0)), (x_1,sin(x_1)), (x_1,sin(x_1)), (x_1,sin(x_1))
    where:
    x_0 = -3
    x_ = -2.6
    x_ = 0
    x_ = 1.2

    By using Newton method an interpolating polinomyal of degree less or equal to 3
    is calculated and ploted in the same graph with
    sin(x) and the interpolation points in the interval [-pi,pi]
    
Inputs:
- "graph.txt" instructions to plot graphs and points. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
    
Outputs:
- "Exit points.txt" containing the ponits to graph the chosen function and the interpolating polinomyal the given display window.
    First column refers to x coordinate, second column refers to y coordinate of original chosen function, third column refers to y coordinate of interpolating polinomyal.
- "Interpolation points.txt" x and y coordinates of interpolating points read from "Enter points.txt"
- "InterNewton Interpolation.png" this image file contents sin(x) graph, the graph of interpolating polinomyal and the interpolation points

Compiler instructions:
- By positioning in the folder where "InterNewtonParticular.c" is stored, use the Makefile placed in this folder, just write "make" and press enter in the terminal

- Results:
    Interpolation polinomyal using Newton method
