Code description:
    This code captures the 101 values of x and y in a cloud of points,
    then it computes and plots the fitting quadratic function corresponding
    to least squares method
    
Inputs:
- "2xx+1.txt" file containing 201 (x,y) points generated from f(x) = -2x^2+1+noise.
- "graph.txt" instructions to plot graphs and points. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
    
Outputs:
- "Exit points.txt" containing the ponits to graph the generated quadratic function g(x).
    First column refers to x coordinate, second column refers to y coordinate.

Compiler instructions:
- By positioning in the folder where "quadratic_regression.c" and "2xx+1+2.txt" are stored, use the Makefile placed in this folder, just write "make" and press enter in the terminal
