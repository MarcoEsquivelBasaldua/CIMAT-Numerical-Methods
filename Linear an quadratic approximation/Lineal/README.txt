Code description:
    This code captures the 201 values of x and y in a cloud of points,
    then it computes and plots the fitting linear function corresponding
    to least squares method
    
Inputs:
- "3x+2.txt" file containing 201 (x,y) points generated from f(x) = 3x+2+noise.
- "graph.txt" instructions to plot graphs and points. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
    
Outputs:
- "Exit points.txt" containing the ponits to graph the generated linear function g(x).
    First column refers to x coordinate, second column refers to y coordinate.

Compiler instructions:
- By positioning in the folder where "linear_regression.c" and "3x+2.txt" are stored, use the Makefile placed in this folder, just write "make" and press enter in the terminal
