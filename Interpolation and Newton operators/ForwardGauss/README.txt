Code description:
    This code captures the value n that correspondes to the total amount of interpolation points (n+1),
    next it captues the x_0 value and x_n values in the file"Enter points.txt".
    According to user selection, points in "Enter points.txt" are interpolated in a given funtion by
    Gauss forward central differences method.
    The original function, the interpolated function and the interpolation points are ploted on the same graph,
    data to plot are stored in exit .txt files.
    
Inputs:
- "Enter points.txt" containing the points to use as interpolation points, first line refers to the (n+1) points to use in the file,
    second line refers to point x_0, third line refers to x_n, (Remember interpolating points are equidistant and these are calculated given (n+1), x_0 and x_n) 
    USER CAN EDIT THIS FILE, make sure these values are in the interval for the chosen function.
- "graph.txt" instructions to plot graphs and points. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
    
Outputs:
- "Exit points.txt" containing the ponits to graph the chosen function and the interpolating polinomyal the given display window.
    First column refers to x coordinate, second column refers to y coordinate of original chosen function, third column refers to y coordinate of interpolating polinomyal.
- "Interpolation points.txt" x and y coordinates of interpolating points read from "Enter points.txt"
- "Gauss Forward Central Interpolation.png" this image file contents the grpah of the chosen function, the graph of interpolating polinomyal and the interpolation        
    points

Compiler instructions:
- By positioning in the folder where "ForwardGauss.c" and "Enter points.txt" are stored, use the Makefile placed in this folder, just write "make" and press enter in the terminal

- Results:
    Interpolation polinomyal using InterNewton method given points in "Enter points.txt"
