Code description:
- This Code captures Matrix A,
- If A is a square Matrix and its determinant is different from 0
      calculates the Inverse matrix of A
    
Inputs:
- M_MEDIUM.txt
    File contenant the a matrix
    the first row in M_MEDIUM.txt has two numbers referring to number of rows and columns in the matrix
    the matrix is then presented by rows and columns.
    
Outputs:
- None

Compiler instructions:
- By positioning in the folder where Inverse.c and M_MEDIUM.txt are stored, use gcc compiler: 
    gcc Inverse.c
- Run: 
    ./a.out M_MEDIUM.txt
- Results:
    The inverse matrix of matrix A is calculated and showed
    Results after execution are displayed in the terminal window.
